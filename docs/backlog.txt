Tasks:

Done:
Front-end:
* Implemented a grid panel that represent the current state of the simulation.
* Implemented a menu that support manual input entry for the environment variables.

Specification:
* Create the basic Drone mechanism : Request Delivery, Pickup , Drop-off packages from/to houses and warehouse.
* Implemented a capacity and inventory management system
* Variant (MustDropoff) : implemented a controller that must drop-off all items for a destination upon entering that location.

-------------------
Left To Do (Sprint 2):
Front-end:
* Implement a "Charging bar" that shows the drone's battery status.
* Implement both new environment variables - 'Strong Winds' & 'Flock of Birds'.
** As a visual effect.
** As an option of input at manual menu.
* Improve visual styling.
* Add to manual menu the ability to enable 'Priority Mode'.

Specification:
* Implement a 'Charging' mechanism: 
s.t. the drone can make an at most X amount of pickups without being charged (returning to the charging station)

* Implement 'Priority Mode' - an environment variable that when is true (i.e. 'Priority Mode' is on) we change our pickup policy:
** The drone prioritize picking up packages from Warehouse over Houses.
** Nonetheless, The drone can pick up at most PRIORITY_CAP number of packages from Houses. This can be parameterized.
*** This was intended to prevent house package starvation.
** When a package is picked up from the Warehouse the # of packages that can be picked up from Houses is reset.

* Implement 'Strong Winds' environment - forbids drone's movement diagonally.
* (New - was not in proposal) Implement 'Flock of birds' - restricts drone's movement from specific "street" on the grid.
