Tasks:

Done:
Front-end:
* Implemented a grid panel that represent the current state of the simulation.
* Implemented a menu that support manual input entry for the environment variables.
* Implement a "Charging bar" that shows the drone's battery status.
* Implement a new environment variables - 'Strong Winds'.
** As a visual effect.
** As an option of input at manual menu.
* Improve visual styling.
* Add to manual menu the ability to enable 'Priority Mode'.
* Add to the Grid a "Control Panel" that summarize all the information about the drone's state.
* Add support for envelopes feature (see Specification)
** Menu support - request envelope delivery
** Grid support - show details on the drone control panel.
* Add Automate Mode (Demo Mode)
* Built scenario management + 3 basic scenarios.
* Built scenario menu.

Specification:
* Create the basic Drone mechanism : Request Delivery, Pickup , Drop-off packages from/to houses and warehouse.
* Implemented a capacity and inventory management system
* Variant (MustDropoff) : implemented a controller that must drop-off all items for a destination upon entering that location.
* Implement a 'Charging' mechanism: 
s.t. the drone can make an at most X amount of pickups without being charged (returning to the charging station)
* Implement 'Priority Mode' - an environment variable that when is true (i.e. 'Priority Mode' is on) we change our pickup policy:
** The drone prioritize picking up packages from Warehouse over Houses.
** Nonetheless, The drone can pick up at most PRIORITY_CAP number of packages from Houses. This can be parameterized.
*** This was intended to prevent house package starvation.
** When a package is picked up from the Warehouse, the # of packages that can be picked up from Houses is reset.
* Implement 'Strong Winds' environment - forbids drone's movement diagonally.
* Added 'envelopes' - light-weight packages.
* Integrated 'Must-Drop-Off' feature to the main specification.

Left To Do (Sprint 4):
Front-end:
* Add more scenarios.
* Add scenario tooltips to the scenario menu (information about each scenario).
* Refactoring.
