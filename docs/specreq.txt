Assumptions:

* At initial state - there are no package/envelope delivery requests (from all houses and the warehouse).
* At initial state - Priority Mode and Winds Mode are off.

* Global - when a any request is made, the request variable is on until the drone picks it up.

Guarantees:

* At initial state - drone starts at Warehouse location.
* At initial state - the drone does not pick-up or drop-off any package.


REQUESTS / PICKUP / DROP-OFF MECHANISM
* A request (src,dest) is PICKED-UP only if the drone is at (src), there is a request waiting at (src) and there's room in the drone's inventory (of the proper type - package/envelope).
* The system guarantees that for each waiting request, the drone will respond with a pickup of that request.
* A request (src,dest) is DROPPED-OFF if and only if the drone is at (dest) and there is a package/envelope intended for (dest) at the drone's inventory.
* The system guarantees that while there are packages/envelopes intended for (dest) at the drone's inventory,
the drone will respond by going to (dest)'s location.
* (Variant) "Must-Pickup" - if the drone is at a house where there's a package/envelope waiting, and he has the capabilty to pick it up - then it must do so.
** This is implemented by adding a guarantee to each house.

MOVEMENT:
* At each state the drone must make a mobility decision , i.e. whether to move a cell (and to which one) or stay put.
** If the drone has no tasks at hand (no requests , no packages/envelopes on it to deliver) it must stay put.
* At the 'Must-Pickup' variant - if the drone is at the charging station, if he did not come from the warehouse, he must pass by the warehouse.
* At 'LessMoves' variant:
** When drone has no more tasks (no requests nor drop-offs) - it returns to the warehouse.
** Don't stagger in a house - when visiting a house, after 1 safety state for stocking, do not visit that house for at least 4 states.
** After every pickup Drone must drop off that package/envelope after at most 2 other steps.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT:
The entire inventory management is implemented with counters:
*totalPackages/Envelopes - # of packages/envelopes on the drone , incremented at pickup and decremented at drop-off.
*(dest)Capacity - # of packages on the drone -intended for (dest)-  incremented when picking up a package to (dest)
and decremented at drop-off.

ENVELOPES:
A different type of request:
* This is implemented by an environment boolean array s.t. if index X is TRUE then package requests at house (X+1) is an envelope.
* Have their own inventory on the drone - implemented by a counter.
* Do not count as 'energy-wasters' - does not decrement the energy counter.
* Note : This is only implemented from Houses.
** A house can request a delivery to either a package OR an envelope (only the last request will made will be satisfied). 

WINDS LOGIC:
* The drone can only move sideways when the winds env variable is true.

PRIORITY HANDLING:
* When the priority mode env variable is true:
The drone can pick up at most PRIORITY_CAP number of requests from Houses before it makes a Warehouse pickup.

BATTERY & ENERGY:
* The drone can make at most MAX_ENERGY package pickups before it passes through the Charging Station.
* (Variant) "Charge-When-Needed" - Do not pass by the charging station unless some amount of eneregy had been used.
** This is implemented by a single guarantee s.t. you can be at the chargining station only if the sys variable energy is at a ceration threshold.
