While working on the envelopes feature we hit large computing times for realizability and for a controller computation.
The solution came unexpectedly - as ADDING another feature - "Must-Drop-Off" actually reduced computing times significantly.
We assume that it restrics the controllers optional moves (for sys variables next state) hence reducing it's computation time.

Other minor issues was integrated the demo and scenario states into the GUI, synchronizing between both the grid and menu panel.
