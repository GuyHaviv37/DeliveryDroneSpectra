We encounted only one main issue on this sprint.
While working on the 'Priority Mode' feature, we tried to added the priority as a new package type.
We thought that this could be done with a new array of env variables (priority requests) that will be monitored
(same as regular ones). This can be viewed at the DeliveryDronePriority-CannotComput.spectra file.
Although, the addition of the new variables together with the new monitors and auxiliary guarantees,
the specification became really hard to compute (together with the other new features it took a lot of time).
So we dealed with it by making a new implementation that can be viewed at the Main specification.
