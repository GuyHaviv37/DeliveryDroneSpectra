MustPickup -
Unrealizabilty - our initial attempt to make this feature was to add guarantees that when the drone has the correct conditions to pick up a waiting package/envelope then it must stay at that location untill pickup.
This became unrealizble - by now we realized that this cannot be enforced in the case that priority mode is on - there can be a state where the drone's local conditions for a pickup (at location, there's a request waiting and has space in inventory),
are not enough to enforce a pickup - since a global condition - such as priority - can disqualify those conditions.
Compute time - once we solved the first issue, we encounted that adding this feature to the main specification increased the computing time tremendously.
The simple soultion was to strip the specification of features - which can be adjusted to the GUI.

Triggers - 
When developing the Triggers variant of the spec. we found it very difficult to attain complex and rich requirements
using triggers only.
Once the rule consisted of regular expressions that indicate more than the drone's location it was made either unrealizable or did not achieve the expected results.
As we still wanted to have a variant using triggers, we did come up with simple, yet meaningful, uses of this spec. feature.
